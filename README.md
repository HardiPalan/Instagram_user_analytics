## Approach

I have employed a structured approach to achieve my project goals:

1. **Database Creation**: I started by creating a MySQL database using Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) SQL queries. The provided data was inserted into the database using MySQL Workbench.

2. **Insight Extraction**: I extracted valuable insights from the database by running SQL queries within MySQL Workbench. These insights cover a range of topics, including user demographics, engagement metrics, posting behavior, and more.

## Tasks and Outputs

My analysis has encompassed several key tasks:

### Task 1: Identifying Oldest Users

I've identified the five oldest users on Instagram based on their account creation dates.

### Task 2: Non-Active Users

I've compiled a list of users who have never posted any photos on Instagram.

### Task 3: Top Liked Users

I've identified the users with the highest number of likes on their posts, which could be potential influencers for marketing collaboration.

### Task 4: Popular Hashtags

I've determined the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform, offering insights for targeted content creation.

### Task 5: User Registration Insights

I've analyzed user registration patterns to pinpoint the most popular days for user sign-ups, aiding in optimal ad campaign scheduling.

### Task 6: User Posting Behavior

I've calculated the average posting frequency per user and the total number of photos on Instagram per user.

### Task 7: Bot Detection

I've identified users who have liked every single photo on the site, which could potentially indicate automated or bot-like behavior.
